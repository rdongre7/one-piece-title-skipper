# Crunchyroll One Piece Title Card Skipper 
Since no one wants to watch a super long recap for every One Piece episode, this extension automatically finds the first commented timestamp (usually the title card) and skips to it.
It's pretty buggy (not the clown) sometimes, so feel free to make changes or lmk if you find any! Chances are if it doesn't work no one's commented a timestamp, though. 

## Set-up
To use: 
1. Clone this repo or download and unpack the zip from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuRIL8mPSpoGP-cmQqdDrOFKHYPkW9Hk/view?usp=sharing
2. Enable developer mode on Chrome (navigate to the Chrome menu -> More Tools -> Extensions) and make sure that the developer mode toggle is on in the top right 
3. Click "Load Unpacked Extension", select the folder from step 1, get your straw hat, and you're good to go! Happy bingeing :)

## Controls
Speed controls are from https://github.com/dannyfan/crunchyroll-playback-speed, but just for ease of access: 
- Shift + up arrow to increase playback speed
- Shift + down arrow to decrease playback speed 
- Shift + R to reset 

# Acknowledgements
- All speed controls are straight up verbatim from https://github.com/dannyfan/crunchyroll-playback-speed - with the pacing issues, I usually watch in 1.25x speed so I adapted this extension to include the recap skipping as well
- Data is obtained from absolutely goated Crunchyroll commenters
