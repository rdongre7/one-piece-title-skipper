# Crunchyroll One Piece Title Card Skipper 

Since no one has time to watch a 10 minute recap for every One Piece episode, this extension automatically parses the timestamp of the title card (usually commented) and skips to it. Only works for Crunchyroll, since data is parsed from the first timestamp comment. Speed adjustment controls are available as well to improve pacing. Happy bingeing! 

## Set up
To use: clone this repo, enable dev mode on chrome, and load the unpacked extension. 
Controls: shift + right arrow to skip to title card
shift + up arrow to increase playback speed
shift + down arrow to decrease playback speed
shift + r to reset playback speed
