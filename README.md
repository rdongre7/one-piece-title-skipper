# Crunchyroll One Piece Title Card Skipper 
Since no one wants to watch a 10 minute recap for every One Piece episode, this extension automatically finds the first commented timestamp (usually the title card) and skips to it.

# Set-up
To use: 
1. Clone this repo or download and unpack the zip from here:  
2. Enable developer mode on Chrome (navigate to the Chrome menu -> More Tools -> Developer Mode) and make sure that the developer mode toggle is on in the top right 
3. Click "Load Unpacked Extension", select the folder from step 1, get your straw hat, and you're good to go! Happy bingeing :)

# Acknowledgements
- All speed controls are straight up verbatim from https://github.com/dannyfan/crunchyroll-playback-speed - with the pacing issues, I usually watch in 1.25x speed so I adapted this extension to include the recap skipping as well
- Data is obtained from absolutely goated Crunchyroll commenters
