# Crunchyroll One Piece Title Card Skipper 

Since no one has time to watch a 10 minute recap for every One Piece episode, this extension automatically parses the timestamp of the title card (usually commented) and skips to it. Only works for Crunchyroll, since data is parsed from the first timestamp comment. Happy bingeing! 

## Set up
To use: clone this repo, enable dev mode on chrome, and load the unpacked extension. 
Controls: shift + right arrow to skip to title card. This extension is a modification of the "Crunchyroll Playback Speed" extension here: https://github.com/dfan001/crunchyroll-playback-speed.git, since it usually helps with pacing to watch OP episodes on 1.25x speed as well. As such, speed adjustment controls are available too.
