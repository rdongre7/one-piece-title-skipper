# Crunchyroll One Piece Title Card Skipper 

Since no one has time to watch a 10 minute recap for every One Piece episode, this extension automatically parses the timestamp of the title card (usually commented) and skips to it. Only works for Crunchyroll, since data is parsed from the first timestamp comment. Speed adjustment controls are available as well to improve pacing. Happy bingeing!

** Note: I haven't tested this as much as I'd have liked, so there might be some bugs. I'd love to hear about any if you find some - please feel free to open an issue! 

## Set-up
To use: clone this repo, enable dev mode on chrome, and load the unpacked extension. 

**Controls**
- Shift + right arrow to skip to title card (One Piece only)
- Shift + up arrow to increase playback speed
- Shift + down arrow to decrease playback speed
- Shift + R to reset playback speed
